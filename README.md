# NYC Subway Data and Styles for mapboxGL

This repo contains a simple mapboxGL web map with data and styles for the New York City Subway.

The data were pulled from the NYC Planning Labs carto server, which is [referenced in the code for their layers api](https://planninglabs.carto.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT * FROM mta_subway_routes&format=SHP).  The styles are also copied from the layers api [here](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-layers-api/blob/develop/data/layer-groups/subway.json), and are the same that show up in [ZoLa](https://zola.planning.nyc.gov), the popular NYC Zoning app.
